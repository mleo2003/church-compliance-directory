<h1>Church Compliance Deadlines in Vermont (2026)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a directory of publicly available official resources — not legal or tax advice.</strong> We link to official state and federal agency pages so church admins can find the right starting point. For advice specific to your situation, consult a licensed attorney or CPA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Vermont is a small state by population but carries a full set of nonprofit and payroll compliance obligations that church administrators need to track. The Vermont Secretary of State requires nonprofit corporations to file an annual report, Vermont has both income tax withholding and unemployment insurance requirements, and the Office of the Attorney General oversees charitable solicitation registration for organizations that fundraise publicly. For churches serving tight-knit rural communities, compliance often falls to a volunteer administrator who manages it alongside other responsibilities — making a clear system essential.</p>
<h2>Who this applies to</h2>
<ul>
<li>Vermont churches that operate as nonprofit entities</li>
<li>Church admins, executive pastors, finance teams, and board secretaries</li>
<li>Churches with employees and recurring payroll obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verified Vermont filing points</h2>
<h3>1) Vermont nonprofit registration/reporting cycle</h3>
<p>Vermont nonprofit corporations are required to file an annual report with the Vermont Secretary of State. The report is due by the end of the third month following the close of the organization's fiscal year. For a calendar-year organization, this means the annual report is due March 31. The filing is completed through the Vermont Secretary of State's online portal (sos.vermont.gov) and carries a filing fee. Failure to file on time results in late fees and eventual administrative dissolution.</p>
<p>Vermont's charitable solicitation registration is administered by the Vermont Office of the Attorney General, Charitable Trusts Unit. Religious organizations are generally exempt from the registration requirement under Vermont law, but the exemption has conditions — specifically that the organization primarily solicits from its own members. Churches conducting broader community fundraising campaigns, telethons, or online donation appeals targeting the general public should confirm whether the exemption applies to their specific activities.</p>
<p>Registered agent information must be kept current with the Secretary of State. If the church's registered agent changes, a Statement of Change of Registered Agent must be filed promptly.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> For calendar-year churches, the annual report is due March 31 — earlier than most states. Build a February reminder to begin the filing process. Review your charitable solicitation activities annually to confirm the religious organization exemption continues to apply.</p>
<h3>2) Vermont payroll tax obligations</h3>
<p>Vermont employers, including churches with paid staff, are required to withhold Vermont state income tax from employee wages. The primary withholding form is WHT-434 (Vermont Withholding Tax Return). Filing frequency is determined by the Vermont Department of Taxes based on withholding volume — employers withholding smaller amounts may file quarterly, while larger withholders file monthly. Annual reconciliation is submitted using Form WHT-434.</p>
<p>Vermont employers must also register with the Vermont Department of Labor for state unemployment insurance (UI). Employers are required to file quarterly wage reports and pay UI contributions. Religious organizations may elect to become reimbursing employers, paying benefits directly rather than making quarterly contributions — a beneficial election for stable churches with low employee turnover. The election must be made in writing.</p>
<p>Vermont also requires employers to carry workers' compensation insurance. This is obtained through private carriers or the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation and is not a tax filing, but it is a required ongoing compliance obligation.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Confirm your withholding tax filing frequency with the Vermont Department of Taxes. Set quarterly reminders for UI reports with the Vermont Department of Labor and evaluate the reimbursing employer option with your CPA.</p>
<h3>3) Federal church filing requirement nuance</h3>
<p>IRS guidance states that tax-exempt organizations generally file annual returns, but churches and some church-affiliated organizations may be excepted.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Don't assume "all churches file 990" or "no churches file anything." Validate your exact entity/facts with your tax advisor.</p>
<h2>Monthly church compliance checklist (practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review upcoming 90-day deadlines (state + payroll + governance)</li>
<li>Confirm owner and status for each open item</li>
<li>Verify any org info changes that require updated filings</li>
<li>Confirm payroll reporting/deposit workflow is on track</li>
<li>Capture board decisions/minutes and any policy updates</li>
<li>Verify volunteer screening/training due dates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common failure patterns we keep seeing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compliance is tracked in scattered spreadsheets with no owner accountability</li>
<li>"We'll remember later" for state filing windows</li>
<li>Payroll and governance tasks treated as separate systems</li>
<li>No monthly review ritual, so deadlines are discovered late</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Compliance Tracker helps</h2>
<p>Turn this from a static checklist into a recurring operating system:
- State-specific deadline tracking
- Reminder windows before due dates
- Explicit task ownership
- Completion/proof log for board and audit confidence</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Compliance Tracker does not reduce legal requirements or filing burden. It reduces admin coordination burden (missed deadlines, unclear owners, weak follow-through).</p>
