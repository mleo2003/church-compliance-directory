<h1>Church Compliance Deadlines in Minnesota (2026)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a directory of publicly available official resources — not legal or tax advice.</strong> We link to official state and federal agency pages so church admins can find the right starting point. For advice specific to your situation, consult a licensed attorney or CPA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you run admin for a Minnesota church, the pain is usually not "what to do" — it's remembering <em>when</em> to do it and who owns it. This draft guide is designed to make that easier.</p>
<h2>Who this applies to</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minnesota churches that operate as nonprofit entities</li>
<li>Church admins, executive pastors, finance teams, and board secretaries</li>
<li>Churches with employees and recurring payroll obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verified Minnesota filing points</h2>
<h3>1) Minnesota nonprofit registration/reporting cycle</h3>
<p>Minnesota nonprofit corporations file an <strong>Annual Renewal</strong> with the Minnesota Secretary of State. The annual renewal is due by December 31 each year, regardless of fiscal year end.</p>
<p>Key considerations:
- Minnesota's annual renewal is filed through the Minnesota Secretary of State's online system (Minnesota Business Filing System)
- The renewal updates registered agent and principal office information
- Failure to file by December 31 results in the organization being placed in "inactive" status, which can lead to dissolution
- Minnesota has a separate charitable solicitation registration requirement administered by the <strong>Minnesota Attorney General's Office</strong> — religious organizations are generally exempt from this requirement under Minnesota Statutes § 309.515, subdivision 1, but affiliated organizations (schools, foundations) may not be; verify before assuming exemption</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> December 31 is a hard annual deadline in Minnesota. Unlike many states where the deadline varies by fiscal year, Minnesota's fixed year-end deadline applies to all nonprofits — which means it can get lost in holiday season. Build reminders starting in October.</p>

</ul>
<h3>2) Minnesota payroll tax obligations</h3>
<p>Minnesota churches with employees must comply with Minnesota Department of Revenue withholding requirements. Minnesota income tax withholding applies to wages paid to employees for services performed in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Key agency and forms:
- <strong>Minnesota Department of Revenue</strong> administers state income tax withholding
- Employers file <strong>Minnesota Employer Withholding</strong> returns — filing frequency (quarterly, monthly, or semi-weekly) is based on withholding volume
- Annual W-2 reconciliation is required (Form MW508 equivalent) and W-2 forms must be distributed to employees
- <strong>Minnesota Unemployment Insurance (UI)</strong> is administered by the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) — religious organizations may have specific exemptions and election options</p>
<p>Key considerations:
- Minnesota UI: churches and religious organizations may be exempt from paying regular UI contributions but can elect to become liable employers or can self-insure; this requires deliberate election, not just assumption of exemption
- Minnesota also has a Paid Leave program (effective 2026) — verify your church's obligations under the new Minnesota Paid Leave law, as it applies to most Minnesota employers</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Minnesota's new Paid Leave program (effective January 2026) adds a new employer compliance layer that many churches have not yet addressed. Confirm your obligations with a Minnesota-familiar payroll provider or CPA.</p>

</ul>
<h3>3) Federal church filing requirement nuance</h3>
<p>IRS guidance states that tax-exempt organizations generally file annual returns, but churches and some church-affiliated organizations may be excepted.</p>
<p>Specifically:
- Churches (as defined by the IRS) are generally not required to file Form 990, 990-EZ, or 990-N
- However, church-affiliated organizations (separate nonprofits, foundations, school ministries) may be required to file depending on their structure and gross receipts
- Filing a 990-N (e-Postcard) voluntarily is an option some churches use to maintain a public record of activity</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Don't assume "all churches file 990" or "no churches file anything." Validate your exact entity/facts with your tax advisor.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Monthly church compliance checklist (practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review upcoming 90-day deadlines (state + payroll + governance)</li>
<li>Confirm owner and status for each open item</li>
<li>Verify any org info changes that require updated filings</li>
<li>Confirm payroll reporting/deposit workflow is on track (including MN Paid Leave)</li>
<li>Capture board decisions/minutes and any policy updates</li>
<li>Verify volunteer screening/training due dates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common failure patterns we keep seeing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compliance is tracked in scattered spreadsheets with no owner accountability</li>
<li>Missing the December 31 annual renewal — it falls during the holiday season and gets overlooked</li>
<li>Minnesota Paid Leave obligations not yet addressed by churches entering 2026</li>
<li>No monthly review ritual, so deadlines are discovered late</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Compliance Tracker helps</h2>
<p>Turn this from a static checklist into a recurring operating system:
- State-specific deadline tracking
- Reminder windows before due dates
- Explicit task ownership
- Completion/proof log for board and audit confidence</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Compliance Tracker does not reduce legal requirements or filing burden. It reduces admin coordination burden.</p>
