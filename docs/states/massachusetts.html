<h1>Church Compliance Deadlines in Massachusetts (2026)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a directory of publicly available official resources — not legal or tax advice.</strong> We link to official state and federal agency pages so church admins can find the right starting point. For advice specific to your situation, consult a licensed attorney or CPA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you run admin for a Massachusetts church, the pain is usually not "what to do" — it's remembering <em>when</em> to do it and who owns it. This draft guide is designed to make that easier.</p>
<h2>Who this applies to</h2>
<ul>
<li>Massachusetts churches that operate as nonprofit entities</li>
<li>Church admins, executive pastors, finance teams, and board secretaries</li>
<li>Churches with employees and recurring payroll obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verified Massachusetts filing points</h2>
<h3>1) Massachusetts nonprofit registration/reporting cycle</h3>
<p>Massachusetts nonprofit corporations file an <strong>Annual Report</strong> with the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth. The report is due annually, with the deadline tied to the organization's fiscal year end.</p>
<p>Additionally, Massachusetts has a separate public charity filing requirement administered by the <strong>Attorney General's Non-Profit Organizations/Public Charities Division</strong>. Most public charities registered in Massachusetts must file an <strong>Annual PC (Public Charities) Filing</strong> each year. However, religious organizations are generally exempt from the public charity registration and annual filing requirements under Massachusetts law (M.G.L. c. 12, § 8F).</p>
<p>Key considerations:
- The Secretary of the Commonwealth annual report maintains corporate good standing — this is distinct from the AG public charity filing
- Annual reports are filed through the Massachusetts Corporations Division online system (Corporations Online)
- Religious organizations should verify whether their exemption from AG registration applies — affiliated entities (schools, foundations) typically do not share the exemption
- Massachusetts requires proper maintenance of corporate records, including board meeting minutes and updated officer/director information</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Massachusetts has two reporting tracks (Secretary of the Commonwealth and Attorney General) that apply differently to churches. Know which your organization is subject to and set deadlines accordingly.</p>

</ul>
<h3>2) Massachusetts payroll tax obligations</h3>
<p>Massachusetts churches with employees must comply with Massachusetts Department of Revenue withholding requirements, as well as the Massachusetts Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML) program.</p>
<p>Key agency and forms:
- <strong>Massachusetts Department of Revenue</strong> administers state income tax withholding
- Employers file <strong>Massachusetts Employer Withholding</strong> returns — filing frequency (monthly, quarterly, or annual) is assigned based on withholding volume
- Annual W-2 reconciliation is required (Form M-3)
- <strong>Massachusetts Department of Family and Medical Leave</strong> administers PFML — employers are generally required to withhold PFML contributions and submit employer contributions unless a private plan exemption is approved
- <strong>Department of Unemployment Assistance</strong> administers UI contributions — religious organizations have specific exemption options</p>
<p>Key considerations:
- Massachusetts PFML is a significant compliance requirement that many out-of-state payroll providers underestimate — religious organizations are generally subject to PFML unless they have an approved exemption
- UI: Massachusetts religious organizations may qualify for an election to reimburse benefits instead of paying quarterly contributions</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Massachusetts has multiple employer compliance layers — income tax withholding, PFML, and UI — all with separate filing requirements. Churches with Massachusetts employees should use a payroll provider experienced with Massachusetts requirements.</p>

<li>Massachusetts Department of Family and Medical Leave — PFML: https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-family-and-medical-leave</li>
<li>Massachusetts Department of Unemployment Assistance: https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-unemployment-assistance</li>
</ul>
<h3>3) Federal church filing requirement nuance</h3>
<p>IRS guidance states that tax-exempt organizations generally file annual returns, but churches and some church-affiliated organizations may be excepted.</p>
<p>Specifically:
- Churches (as defined by the IRS) are generally not required to file Form 990, 990-EZ, or 990-N
- However, church-affiliated organizations (separate nonprofits, foundations, school ministries) may be required to file depending on their structure and gross receipts
- Filing a 990-N (e-Postcard) voluntarily is an option some churches use to maintain a public record of activity</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Don't assume "all churches file 990" or "no churches file anything." Validate your exact entity/facts with your tax advisor.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Monthly church compliance checklist (practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review upcoming 90-day deadlines (state + payroll + governance)</li>
<li>Confirm owner and status for each open item</li>
<li>Verify any org info changes that require updated filings</li>
<li>Confirm payroll reporting/deposit workflow is on track (including PFML contributions)</li>
<li>Capture board decisions/minutes and any policy updates</li>
<li>Verify volunteer screening/training due dates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common failure patterns we keep seeing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compliance is tracked in scattered spreadsheets with no owner accountability</li>
<li>Massachusetts PFML obligations missed entirely — especially by churches using out-of-state payroll providers</li>
<li>Payroll and governance tasks treated as separate systems</li>
<li>Confusion between Secretary of Commonwealth and AG filing requirements</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Compliance Tracker helps</h2>
<p>Turn this from a static checklist into a recurring operating system:
- State-specific deadline tracking
- Reminder windows before due dates
- Explicit task ownership
- Completion/proof log for board and audit confidence</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Compliance Tracker does not reduce legal requirements or filing burden. It reduces admin coordination burden.</p>
