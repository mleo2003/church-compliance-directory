<h1>Church Compliance Deadlines in Wyoming (2026)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a directory of publicly available official resources — not legal or tax advice.</strong> We link to official state and federal agency pages so church admins can find the right starting point. For advice specific to your situation, consult a licensed attorney or CPA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wyoming is widely recognized as one of the most business- and organization-friendly states in the country. It has no state income tax, which eliminates an entire category of withholding compliance that burdens church admins in most other states. That said, Wyoming nonprofits still have a Secretary of State annual report obligation and unemployment insurance requirements if they have employees. This guide surfaces the real deadlines so your team isn't managing Wyoming compliance from memory.</p>
<h2>Who this applies to</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wyoming churches that operate as nonprofit entities incorporated under Wyoming law</li>
<li>Church admins, executive pastors, finance teams, and board secretaries</li>
<li>Churches with employees and recurring payroll obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verified Wyoming filing points</h2>
<h3>1) Wyoming nonprofit annual report cycle</h3>
<p>Wyoming nonprofits — including churches incorporated as nonprofit corporations — file an annual report with the <strong>Wyoming Secretary of State</strong>. The report is due on the <strong>first day of the anniversary month</strong> of the corporation's original filing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Wyoming Secretary of State, Business Division</li>
<li><strong>Filing portal:</strong> <a href="https://wyobiz.wyo.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://wyobiz.wyo.gov/</a></li>
<li><strong>Fee:</strong> Wyoming does not charge an annual report fee for nonprofit corporations (confirm at time of filing, as fee schedules can change)</li>
<li><strong>What triggers it:</strong> Any Wyoming nonprofit corporation registered with the Secretary of State</li>
<li><strong>Consequence of missing it:</strong> Failure to file the annual report can result in administrative dissolution. Wyoming does allow reinstatement, but reinstatement involves additional steps and costs. More practically, a lapsed corporate status can complicate banking, contracts, and insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The deadline being tied to the anniversary month — rather than a fixed calendar date — is a common source of confusion. If your church incorporated in June, your annual report is due June 1 each year, regardless of your fiscal year.</p>
<h3>2) Wyoming payroll tax obligations</h3>
<p><strong>Wyoming has no state income tax.</strong> This means there is no state withholding obligation for employee wages — a meaningful compliance simplification compared to most states.</p>
<p>There is no WT equivalent form, no state withholding deposit schedule, and no annual state withholding reconciliation. Church payroll teams processing Wyoming-only payroll do not need to maintain a state withholding account.</p>
<p>However, <strong>federal payroll obligations still apply in full:</strong>
- Federal income tax withholding (reported and deposited on IRS Form 941 schedule)
- FICA (Social Security and Medicare) — both employee and employer share
- FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) — reported on Form 940</p>
<p>Churches with employees must still manage the full federal payroll compliance stack even though Wyoming state withholding does not exist.</p>
<h3>3) Wyoming Unemployment Insurance</h3>
<p>Wyoming does have a state unemployment insurance system, administered by the <strong>Wyoming Department of Workforce Services (DWS)</strong>. Employers with covered employees are required to register and file quarterly wage reports.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Wyoming Department of Workforce Services</li>
<li><strong>Portal:</strong> <a href="https://wyoming.gov/business/workforce" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://wyoming.gov/business/workforce</a></li>
<li><strong>Reporting cadence:</strong> Quarterly wage reports are due approximately one month after each quarter end (Q1 due ~April 30, Q2 due ~July 31, Q3 due ~October 31, Q4 due ~January 31)</li>
<li><strong>Religious organization exemption:</strong> Wyoming law may provide exemptions for certain religious organizations from UI coverage. This is a fact-specific determination — review DWS guidance or consult legal counsel to confirm whether your church's employees are covered.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if your church qualifies for a UI exemption for some employees, confirm the exemption status formally with DWS rather than assuming it applies.</p>
<h3>4) Federal church filing requirement nuance</h3>
<p>IRS guidance states that tax-exempt organizations generally file annual returns (Form 990 series), but <strong>churches</strong> and certain church-affiliated organizations may be excepted from this requirement under IRC Section 6033(a)(3).</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Don't assume "all churches file 990" or "no churches file anything." Validate your exact entity/facts with your tax advisor. If your organization is a church-affiliated school, daycare, or separately incorporated ministry, the 990 exemption may not apply to that entity.</p>
<h2>Monthly church compliance checklist (practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review upcoming 90-day deadlines (Secretary of State annual report + payroll + governance)</li>
<li>Confirm owner and status for each open item</li>
<li>Verify any org info changes that require updated filings (address, officers, registered agent)</li>
<li>Confirm federal payroll reporting/deposit workflow is on track (941 deposits — no state withholding to track)</li>
<li>Capture board decisions/minutes and any policy updates</li>
<li>Verify volunteer screening/training due dates</li>
<li>Confirm UI quarterly wage report is submitted if you have covered employees</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common failure patterns we keep seeing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compliance is tracked in scattered spreadsheets with no owner accountability</li>
<li>Wyoming's anniversary-month deadline is missed because teams assume a fixed calendar date (it is not)</li>
<li>"No state income tax" gets mentally expanded to "no payroll compliance" — federal obligations are still fully in effect</li>
<li>UI exemption for religious organizations is assumed rather than confirmed with DWS</li>
<li>No monthly review ritual, so deadlines are discovered late</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Compliance Tracker helps</h2>
<p>Turn this from a static checklist into a recurring operating system:
- State-specific deadline tracking for Wyoming Secretary of State and DWS obligations
- Reminder windows before due dates — including anniversary-month alerts
- Explicit task ownership
- Completion/proof log for board and audit confidence</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Compliance Tracker does not reduce legal requirements or filing burden. It reduces admin coordination burden (missed deadlines, unclear owners, weak follow-through).</p>
<p><strong>CTA:</strong> Get pilot access to Compliance Tracker and we'll map your Wyoming workflow in one setup session.</p>
