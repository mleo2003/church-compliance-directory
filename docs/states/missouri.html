<h1>Church Compliance Deadlines in Missouri (2026)</h1>

<p><strong>This is a directory of publicly available official resources — not legal or tax advice.</strong> We link to official state and federal agency pages so church admins can find the right starting point. For advice specific to your situation, consult a licensed attorney or CPA.</p>

<p>If you run admin for a Missouri church, the pain is usually not "what to do" — it's remembering <em>when</em> to do it and who owns it. This draft guide is designed to make that easier.</p>
<h2>Who this applies to</h2>
<ul>
<li>Missouri churches that operate as nonprofit entities</li>
<li>Church admins, executive pastors, finance teams, and board secretaries</li>
<li>Churches with employees and recurring payroll obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verified Missouri filing points</h2>
<h3>1) Missouri nonprofit registration/reporting cycle</h3>
<p>Missouri nonprofit corporations are organized under Missouri's nonprofit corporation law, but Missouri does not require an annual report in the same form as many other states. However, Missouri nonprofits must maintain a <strong>Registered Agent</strong> in good standing with the Missouri Secretary of State, and changes to the registered agent or registered office require timely filing.</p>
<p>Key considerations:
- Missouri does not have a standard annual report fee or filing cycle for nonprofits — this is a notable difference from most states
- However, Missouri nonprofits must file updates when key information changes (registered agent, principal office) to stay in good standing
- The Missouri Secretary of State's online portal (Missouri Business Portal / Corporations) is the filing system for any required updates
- Missouri has a charitable solicitation registration requirement administered by the Missouri Attorney General's Office — religious organizations are generally exempt from registration under Missouri law (§ 407.467 RSMo), but confirm this exemption applies to your specific organization and structure</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Missouri's lack of a formal annual report can give nonprofit admins a false sense that "nothing is due." In reality, ongoing good standing requires keeping registered agent information current and being responsive to any state-required updates. Confirm your registered agent is current at least annually.</p>

</ul>
<h3>2) Missouri payroll tax obligations</h3>
<p>Missouri churches with employees must comply with Missouri Department of Revenue income tax withholding requirements. Missouri imposes a state income tax on wages, and employers must register to withhold and remit Missouri income tax.</p>
<p>Key agency and forms:
- <strong>Missouri Department of Revenue</strong> administers state income tax withholding
- Employers file <strong>Missouri Employer's Return of Income Taxes Withheld (Form MO-941)</strong> — filing frequency (monthly or quarterly) is based on withholding volume
- Annual withholding tax reconciliation (Form MO-W3) and W-2 distribution are required at year end
- <strong>Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, Division of Employment Security</strong> administers UI contributions — religious organizations may have specific exemptions and reimbursement election options</p>
<p>Key considerations:
- Missouri religious organization UI status: churches and religious organizations may be exempt from mandatory UI contributions under Missouri law but must verify this status with the Division of Employment Security; elective coverage is also available
- Missouri has no local income tax in most jurisdictions (Kansas City and St. Louis are notable exceptions with earnings taxes) — if your church has employees working in Kansas City or St. Louis city, additional local tax withholding obligations apply</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Missouri is simpler than many states for most churches, but churches with employees in Kansas City or St. Louis proper face additional local payroll tax obligations. Confirm all layers with your payroll provider.</p>

</ul>
<h3>3) Federal church filing requirement nuance</h3>
<p>IRS guidance states that tax-exempt organizations generally file annual returns, but churches and some church-affiliated organizations may be excepted.</p>
<p>Specifically:
- Churches (as defined by the IRS) are generally not required to file Form 990, 990-EZ, or 990-N
- However, church-affiliated organizations (separate nonprofits, foundations, school ministries) may be required to file depending on their structure and gross receipts
- Filing a 990-N (e-Postcard) voluntarily is an option some churches use to maintain a public record of activity</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Don't assume "all churches file 990" or "no churches file anything." Validate your exact entity/facts with your tax advisor.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Monthly church compliance checklist (practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review upcoming 90-day deadlines (state + payroll + governance)</li>
<li>Confirm owner and status for each open item</li>
<li>Verify registered agent information is current (Missouri has no annual report, so this requires active attention)</li>
<li>Confirm payroll reporting/deposit workflow is on track</li>
<li>Capture board decisions/minutes and any policy updates</li>
<li>Verify volunteer screening/training due dates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common failure patterns we keep seeing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compliance is tracked in scattered spreadsheets with no owner accountability</li>
<li>Missouri's lack of an annual report leads to "nothing to track" assumption — registered agent lapses go unnoticed</li>
<li>Kansas City / St. Louis local earnings tax not addressed for employees in those cities</li>
<li>No monthly review ritual, so gaps are discovered late</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Compliance Tracker helps</h2>
<p>Turn this from a static checklist into a recurring operating system:
- State-specific deadline tracking
- Reminder windows before due dates
- Explicit task ownership
- Completion/proof log for board and audit confidence</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Compliance Tracker does not reduce legal requirements or filing burden. It reduces admin coordination burden.</p>
