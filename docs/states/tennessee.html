<h1>Church Compliance Deadlines in Tennessee (2026)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a directory of publicly available official resources — not legal or tax advice.</strong> We link to official state and federal agency pages so church admins can find the right starting point. For advice specific to your situation, consult a licensed attorney or CPA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tennessee is home to a dense concentration of churches per capita, and the state's compliance environment reflects a mix of light corporate reporting obligations and active charitable solicitation oversight. Tennessee eliminated its Hall income tax on investment income, and there is no broad state income tax on wages — which removes state payroll withholding from the equation for most churches. But the Department of Revenue still requires unemployment insurance compliance, and the Secretary of State's nonprofit reporting requirements remain an active obligation. Church admins who assume Tennessee is "compliance-free" because of the income tax situation often get caught by the charitable solicitation registration deadline.</p>
<h2>Who this applies to</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tennessee churches that operate as nonprofit entities</li>
<li>Church admins, executive pastors, finance teams, and board secretaries</li>
<li>Churches with employees and recurring payroll obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verified Tennessee filing points</h2>
<h3>1) Tennessee nonprofit registration/reporting cycle</h3>
<p>Tennessee nonprofit corporations are required to file an annual report with the Tennessee Secretary of State. The due date is the end of the fourth month following the close of the nonprofit's fiscal year. For a calendar-year organization, this means the annual report is due April 30. The filing is submitted through the Tennessee Secretary of State's online portal (tnbear.tn.gov) and carries a filing fee. Administrative dissolution for non-filing requires a reinstatement process.</p>
<p>Tennessee also has an active charitable solicitation registration program administered by the Division of Charitable Solicitations and Gaming within the Secretary of State's office. Religious organizations are generally exempt from the charitable solicitation registration requirement under Tennessee law, but the exemption has conditions. If your church operates affiliated entities or conducts broad public fundraising campaigns through separate organizations, those activities may require registration. Review the specific exemption criteria with legal counsel.</p>
<p>Churches should also ensure their registered agent information remains current with the Secretary of State. Registered agent changes require a formal filing and a fee.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> For calendar-year churches, April 30 is the annual report deadline. Confirm your fiscal year end and calculate your specific due date. Separately, confirm whether your solicitation activities qualify for the religious organization exemption from charitable registration.</p>
<h3>2) Tennessee payroll tax obligations</h3>
<p>Tennessee does not impose a broad state income tax on wages, which means there is no state income tax withholding requirement for employee salaries. This eliminates one category of recurring payroll tax filings that churches in most other states must manage. Note: Tennessee's Hall Income Tax (on investment income) was fully repealed as of 2022, so that is no longer a compliance concern.</p>
<p>Tennessee employers, including churches with paid staff, are required to register with the Tennessee Department of Labor and Workforce Development for state unemployment insurance (SUI). Employers must file quarterly wage reports and pay SUI contributions. Religious organizations may elect reimbursing employer status, which means the church reimburses the state directly for benefits paid to former employees rather than paying quarterly contributions. This election must be made in writing and is often economically favorable for churches with stable workforces and low turnover.</p>
<p>Quarterly SUI reports are due by the last day of the month following the end of each calendar quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Since there is no state income tax withholding in Tennessee, your state payroll compliance focus is unemployment insurance. Register with the TN Department of Labor and Workforce Development and evaluate the reimbursing employer election with your CPA.</p>
<h3>3) Federal church filing requirement nuance</h3>
<p>IRS guidance states that tax-exempt organizations generally file annual returns, but churches and some church-affiliated organizations may be excepted.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Don't assume "all churches file 990" or "no churches file anything." Validate your exact entity/facts with your tax advisor.</p>
<h2>Monthly church compliance checklist (practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review upcoming 90-day deadlines (state + payroll + governance)</li>
<li>Confirm owner and status for each open item</li>
<li>Verify any org info changes that require updated filings</li>
<li>Confirm payroll reporting/deposit workflow is on track</li>
<li>Capture board decisions/minutes and any policy updates</li>
<li>Verify volunteer screening/training due dates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common failure patterns we keep seeing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compliance is tracked in scattered spreadsheets with no owner accountability</li>
<li>"We'll remember later" for state filing windows</li>
<li>Payroll and governance tasks treated as separate systems</li>
<li>No monthly review ritual, so deadlines are discovered late</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Compliance Tracker helps</h2>
<p>Turn this from a static checklist into a recurring operating system:
- State-specific deadline tracking
- Reminder windows before due dates
- Explicit task ownership
- Completion/proof log for board and audit confidence</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Compliance Tracker does not reduce legal requirements or filing burden. It reduces admin coordination burden (missed deadlines, unclear owners, weak follow-through).</p>
