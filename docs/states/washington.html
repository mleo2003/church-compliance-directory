<h1>Church Compliance Deadlines in Washington (2026)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a directory of publicly available official resources — not legal or tax advice.</strong> We link to official state and federal agency pages so church admins can find the right starting point. For advice specific to your situation, consult a licensed attorney or CPA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Washington State has no personal income tax — a fact many church administrators know. What they sometimes overlook is that this doesn't eliminate payroll compliance. Washington has multiple employer-side payroll obligations including unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, and the state's Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML) program, all of which require quarterly reporting and contributions. Add to this the Secretary of State's annual nonprofit renewal, a charitable solicitation registration program, and a robust charitable registration regime, and Washington churches have a real compliance workload to manage year-round.</p>
<h2>Who this applies to</h2>
<ul>
<li>Washington churches that operate as nonprofit entities</li>
<li>Church admins, executive pastors, finance teams, and board secretaries</li>
<li>Churches with employees and recurring payroll obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verified Washington filing points</h2>
<h3>1) Washington nonprofit registration/reporting cycle</h3>
<p>Washington nonprofit corporations must file an annual renewal with the Washington Secretary of State's Corporations and Charities Division. The renewal is due by the end of the month in which the organization was incorporated. Filing is completed through the Washington Corporations and Charities Filing System (CCFS) at ccfs.sos.wa.gov. The renewal fee is modest, but failure to renew results in administrative dissolution.</p>
<p>Washington State has an active charitable solicitation registration program, also administered through the Secretary of State's Corporations and Charities Division. Religious organizations — churches, mosques, synagogues, and similar bodies — are generally exempt from charitable solicitation registration requirements when soliciting from their own members. However, churches that solicit from the general public, participate in combined campaigns, or conduct solicitations outside their membership base should review whether an exemption applies. If registration is required, the annual renewal is due by the 15th day of the fifth month after the organization's fiscal year end.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Identify your incorporation anniversary month and set a 60-day advance reminder for the annual renewal. Review your public solicitation activities annually to confirm whether the charitable registration exemption continues to apply to your ministry model.</p>
<h3>2) Washington payroll tax obligations</h3>
<p>Washington has no state income tax, which means there is no state income tax withholding requirement — a significant simplification compared to most states. However, Washington employers have multiple other payroll-related compliance obligations:</p>
<p><strong>Unemployment Insurance (ESD):</strong> Washington employers must register with the Washington Employment Security Department (ESD) and file quarterly unemployment insurance tax reports. The Business Licensing Service and ESD jointly handle registration. Quarterly reports are due by the last day of the month following each quarter. Religious organizations may apply for an exemption from unemployment tax contributions, but the exemption is not automatic and requires a formal application. Churches should review RCW 50.44.040 and confirm their status.</p>
<p><strong>Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML):</strong> Washington's PFML program requires most employers to collect and remit PFML premiums quarterly. Religious employers are not broadly exempt from this obligation. Premium payments and quarterly reports are due by the last day of the month following each quarter. This is a relatively new but significant ongoing obligation for Washington churches with employees.</p>
<p><strong>Workers' Compensation (L&amp;I):</strong> Washington's workers' compensation system is administered by the Department of Labor and Industries (L&amp;I). Employers must register, file quarterly reports, and pay premiums based on hours worked and risk classifications. Religious organizations are not exempt from workers' compensation requirements for paid employees.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Washington's lack of income tax withholding is the good news. The offsetting reality is three separate quarterly reporting systems (ESD, PFML, L&amp;I) that all require attention. Build unified quarterly reminders and confirm your church's exemption status for unemployment insurance with an employment attorney or CPA.</p>
<h3>3) Federal church filing requirement nuance</h3>
<p>IRS guidance states that tax-exempt organizations generally file annual returns, but churches and some church-affiliated organizations may be excepted.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Don't assume "all churches file 990" or "no churches file anything." Validate your exact entity/facts with your tax advisor.</p>
<h2>Monthly church compliance checklist (practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review upcoming 90-day deadlines (state + payroll + governance)</li>
<li>Confirm owner and status for each open item</li>
<li>Verify any org info changes that require updated filings</li>
<li>Confirm payroll reporting/deposit workflow is on track (ESD, PFML, L&amp;I in WA)</li>
<li>Capture board decisions/minutes and any policy updates</li>
<li>Verify volunteer screening/training due dates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common failure patterns we keep seeing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compliance is tracked in scattered spreadsheets with no owner accountability</li>
<li>"We'll remember later" for state filing windows</li>
<li>Payroll and governance tasks treated as separate systems — especially in WA where there are three separate quarterly payroll programs</li>
<li>No monthly review ritual, so deadlines are discovered late</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Compliance Tracker helps</h2>
<p>Turn this from a static checklist into a recurring operating system:
- State-specific deadline tracking
- Reminder windows before due dates
- Explicit task ownership
- Completion/proof log for board and audit confidence</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Compliance Tracker does not reduce legal requirements or filing burden. It reduces admin coordination burden (missed deadlines, unclear owners, weak follow-through).</p>
<p><strong>CTA:</strong> Get pilot access to Compliance Tracker and we'll map your Washington workflow in one setup session.</p>
