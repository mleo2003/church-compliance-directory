<h1>Church Compliance Deadlines in Virginia (2026)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a directory of publicly available official resources — not legal or tax advice.</strong> We link to official state and federal agency pages so church admins can find the right starting point. For advice specific to your situation, consult a licensed attorney or CPA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Virginia has one of the more active nonprofit compliance environments on the East Coast. The State Corporation Commission (SCC) requires annual filings, the Office of the Attorney General has a Charitable Organizations section that administers solicitation registration, and the Virginia Department of Taxation has full payroll withholding requirements. For larger churches in the Northern Virginia, Richmond, or Hampton Roads metro areas — many of which have substantial staff and complex operations — compliance tracking across multiple agencies is a real operational challenge. Even smaller rural Virginia churches face all the same agency requirements; the volume just differs.</p>
<h2>Who this applies to</h2>
<ul>
<li>Virginia churches that operate as nonprofit entities</li>
<li>Church admins, executive pastors, finance teams, and board secretaries</li>
<li>Churches with employees and recurring payroll obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verified Virginia filing points</h2>
<h3>1) Virginia nonprofit registration/reporting cycle</h3>
<p>Virginia nonprofit corporations must file an annual report with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC). The annual report is due by the last day of the 13th month following the month of the organization's anniversary date of incorporation. The SCC sends a reminder notice, but the responsibility for timely filing rests with the organization. Filing is completed through the SCC's Clerk's Information System (CIS) portal. Failure to file results in a notice of potential dissolution.</p>
<p>Virginia's charitable solicitation registration is administered by the Office of the Attorney General's Charitable Organizations section under the Virginia Solicitation of Contributions Law. Religious organizations — specifically churches, synagogues, and other religious bodies — are generally exempt from registration requirements. However, organizations that use professional fundraising counsel or conduct campaigns that are primarily commercial in nature may lose the exemption. Any affiliated charitable organizations (e.g., a church-sponsored food bank or community development corporation) should be evaluated for registration requirements separately.</p>
<p>Churches should keep their registered agent information current with the SCC. A change of registered agent requires a formal filing through the CIS portal.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Calculate your specific annual report due date based on your SCC anniversary month, and build a reminder 60 days before the deadline. Confirm the religious organization solicitation exemption applies to your specific ministry model, particularly if you have affiliated charitable entities.</p>
<h3>2) Virginia payroll tax obligations</h3>
<p>Virginia employers, including churches with paid employees, are required to withhold Virginia state income tax from employee wages. The Virginia Department of Taxation administers payroll withholding using Form VA-5 (semi-weekly or monthly employers) and Form VA-15 (for large employers on accelerated schedules). Annual reconciliation is filed using Form VA-6. The filing frequency is based on the average monthly withholding amount — small employers with modest withholding may file quarterly.</p>
<p>Virginia employers must also register with the Virginia Employment Commission (VEC) for state unemployment insurance (SUI). Quarterly wage reports (Form VEC-FC-20/21) are due by the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter. Religious organizations may elect reimbursing employer status, which removes the quarterly contribution requirement and replaces it with direct reimbursement of actual benefit charges. This election is often economically favorable for churches with stable employee rosters.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Confirm your withholding filing frequency with the Virginia Department of Taxation and set calendar reminders for quarterly VEC reports. If your church hasn't evaluated reimbursing employer status with the VEC, it's worth reviewing with your CPA.</p>
<h3>3) Federal church filing requirement nuance</h3>
<p>IRS guidance states that tax-exempt organizations generally file annual returns, but churches and some church-affiliated organizations may be excepted.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Don't assume "all churches file 990" or "no churches file anything." Validate your exact entity/facts with your tax advisor.</p>
<h2>Monthly church compliance checklist (practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review upcoming 90-day deadlines (state + payroll + governance)</li>
<li>Confirm owner and status for each open item</li>
<li>Verify any org info changes that require updated filings</li>
<li>Confirm payroll reporting/deposit workflow is on track</li>
<li>Capture board decisions/minutes and any policy updates</li>
<li>Verify volunteer screening/training due dates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common failure patterns we keep seeing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compliance is tracked in scattered spreadsheets with no owner accountability</li>
<li>"We'll remember later" for state filing windows</li>
<li>Payroll and governance tasks treated as separate systems</li>
<li>No monthly review ritual, so deadlines are discovered late</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Compliance Tracker helps</h2>
<p>Turn this from a static checklist into a recurring operating system:
- State-specific deadline tracking
- Reminder windows before due dates
- Explicit task ownership
- Completion/proof log for board and audit confidence</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Compliance Tracker does not reduce legal requirements or filing burden. It reduces admin coordination burden (missed deadlines, unclear owners, weak follow-through).</p>
