<h1>Church Compliance Deadlines in Hawaii (2026)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a directory of publicly available official resources — not legal or tax advice.</strong> We link to official state and federal agency pages so church admins can find the right starting point. For advice specific to your situation, consult a licensed attorney or CPA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you run admin for a Hawaii church, the pain is usually not "what to do" — it's remembering <em>when</em> to do it and who owns it. This draft guide is designed to make that easier.</p>
<h2>Who this applies to</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hawaii churches that operate as nonprofit entities</li>
<li>Church admins, executive pastors, finance teams, and board secretaries</li>
<li>Churches with employees and recurring payroll obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verified Hawaii filing points</h2>
<h3>1) Hawaii nonprofit annual report and charitable registration cycle</h3>
<p>Hawaii nonprofit corporations are registered through the <strong>Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (DCCA)</strong>, Business Registration Division. Hawaii requires nonprofits to file an <strong>Annual Report</strong> with the DCCA. The due date is based on the entity's anniversary quarter — specifically, the last day of the calendar quarter in which the anniversary of incorporation falls.</p>
<p>Hawaii has an online business filing portal (Hawaii Business Express) where entities can file annual reports and check good standing. Failure to file can lead to administrative dissolution.</p>
<p>Hawaii also administers a <strong>Charitable Solicitations</strong> registration requirement through the DCCA. Organizations soliciting charitable contributions from Hawaii residents are required to register and renew annually. Religious organizations are often exempt from this registration under Hawaii law (HRS Chapter 467B), but the exemption conditions should be verified based on the specific activities of the church.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Determine your entity's anniversary quarter and set a reminder for the last day of that quarter. Verify whether your church's fundraising activities qualify for the charitable solicitation exemption.</p>
<h3>2) Hawaii payroll tax obligations — notably complex</h3>
<p>Hawaii has one of the more complex employer payroll compliance environments in the nation:</p>
<p><strong>State income tax withholding</strong> is administered by the <strong>Hawaii Department of Taxation</strong>:
- <strong>Form HW-14</strong>: Hawaii Withholding Tax Return — frequency depends on withholding volume (semi-monthly, monthly, or quarterly)
- Annual reconciliation (HW-3) with W-2s is due by the last day of February</p>
<p><strong>Unemployment Insurance (UI)</strong> is administered by the <strong>Hawaii Department of Labor and Industrial Relations (DLIR)</strong>:
- Quarterly wage reports (UC-B6) and UI contributions are required
- Nonprofit employers may elect reimbursable employer status</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI)</strong>: Hawaii is one of five states requiring employers to provide Temporary Disability Insurance coverage. Employers must either obtain an approved TDI plan (through a carrier or a state-approved self-insured plan) or participate in the state plan. TDI covers non-work-related illness or injury. Churches with employees must comply with this requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act (PHCA)</strong>: Hawaii requires most employers to provide qualified health coverage to employees working 20 or more hours per week for four or more consecutive weeks. This is a unique Hawaii employment law requirement with compliance obligations. Confirm your health plan meets PHCA standards.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Hawaii's payroll and benefit compliance is unusually layered — withholding, UI, TDI, and PHCA. If your church operates in Hawaii, confirm all four obligations are addressed with a Hawaii-experienced payroll provider or HR advisor.</p>
<h3>3) Federal church filing requirement nuance</h3>
<p>IRS guidance states that tax-exempt organizations generally file annual returns, but churches and some church-affiliated organizations may be excepted.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Don't assume "all churches file 990" or "no churches file anything." Validate your exact entity/facts with your tax advisor.</p>
<h2>Monthly church compliance checklist (practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review upcoming 90-day deadlines (state + payroll + governance)</li>
<li>Confirm owner and status for each open item</li>
<li>Verify any org info changes that require updated filings with DCCA</li>
<li>Confirm payroll reporting/deposit workflow is on track (withholding, UI, TDI, PHCA)</li>
<li>Capture board decisions/minutes and any policy updates</li>
<li>Verify volunteer screening/training due dates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common failure patterns we keep seeing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compliance is tracked in scattered spreadsheets with no owner accountability</li>
<li>TDI and PHCA obligations overlooked by out-of-state denominational offices not familiar with Hawaii law</li>
<li>Charitable solicitation registration renewal missed on a different cycle than the DCCA annual report</li>
<li>No monthly review ritual, so deadlines are discovered late</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Compliance Tracker helps</h2>
<p>Turn this from a static checklist into a recurring operating system:
- State-specific deadline tracking
- Reminder windows before due dates
- Explicit task ownership
- Completion/proof log for board and audit confidence</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Compliance Tracker does not reduce legal requirements or filing burden. It reduces admin coordination burden (missed deadlines, unclear owners, weak follow-through).</p>
