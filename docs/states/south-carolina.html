<h1>Church Compliance Deadlines in South Carolina (2026)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a directory of publicly available official resources — not legal or tax advice.</strong> We link to official state and federal agency pages so church admins can find the right starting point. For advice specific to your situation, consult a licensed attorney or CPA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Church administrators in South Carolina manage a quieter compliance landscape than some states — but "quieter" doesn't mean "zero obligations." The combination of Secretary of State charitable registration requirements, SC Department of Revenue payroll withholding, and SC Department of Employment and Workforce unemployment insurance still creates multiple recurring deadlines that can catch a distracted admin off guard. The challenge isn't the complexity; it's the lack of a single consolidated system to track everything across teams.</p>
<h2>Who this applies to</h2>
<ul>
<li>South Carolina churches that operate as nonprofit entities</li>
<li>Church admins, executive pastors, finance teams, and board secretaries</li>
<li>Churches with employees and recurring payroll obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verified South Carolina filing points</h2>
<h3>1) South Carolina nonprofit registration/reporting cycle</h3>
<p>South Carolina does not require a separate annual report filing from registered nonprofits with the Secretary of State in the same way many states do. However, churches and religious organizations that solicit charitable contributions from the public in South Carolina must register with the Secretary of State's Office under the Solicitation of Charitable Funds Act — unless they qualify for an exemption. Religious organizations that solicit solely from their own membership generally qualify for an exemption from registration requirements.</p>
<p>Churches that do conduct public charitable solicitations (e.g., broad fundraising campaigns, community appeals) and do not qualify for the membership exemption must file an annual registration and financial report with the SC Secretary of State's Office. The registration year runs from July 1 through June 30, and renewals are due annually. The filing fee and required disclosures vary based on total contributions received.</p>
<p>If your church operates separate charitable arms — such as a food pantry or community foundation — those entities may face distinct registration requirements, even if the parent church itself qualifies for an exemption. Confirm your specific situation with legal counsel.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Determine whether your church's solicitation activities require registration. If exempt, document that determination in your governance records and review it annually when ministry activities change.</p>
<h3>2) South Carolina payroll tax obligations</h3>
<p>South Carolina employers, including churches with paid staff, must register with the SC Department of Revenue (SCDOR) to withhold state income tax from employee wages. The primary form is the SC WH-1600 (Withholding Tax Return), filed on a monthly or quarterly schedule depending on the volume of withholding. Employers withholding $15,000 or more per year file monthly; smaller employers typically file quarterly. Annual reconciliation is filed using Form WH-1605 (Annual Withholding Reconciliation).</p>
<p>Churches with employees must also register with the SC Department of Employment and Workforce (DEW) for state unemployment insurance (SUI). Religious organizations can elect to reimburse the unemployment fund rather than pay contributions on a quarterly basis — a common election for churches that want to avoid the standard SUI tax rate. This election must be made in writing when registering. Quarterly wage reports are due by the last day of the month following each calendar quarter.</p>
<p>Note that churches are often exempt from FUTA (federal unemployment tax) under IRC Section 3306(c)(8), but this does not automatically exempt them from state unemployment obligations. Confirm your church's specific status with your payroll provider or CPA.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Confirm your SC withholding deposit frequency with SCDOR and set up calendar reminders for quarterly DEW reports. If you haven't made the reimbursing employer election, review whether it makes financial sense for your church's employment patterns.</p>
<h3>3) Federal church filing requirement nuance</h3>
<p>IRS guidance states that tax-exempt organizations generally file annual returns, but churches and some church-affiliated organizations may be excepted.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Don't assume "all churches file 990" or "no churches file anything." Validate your exact entity/facts with your tax advisor.</p>
<h2>Monthly church compliance checklist (practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review upcoming 90-day deadlines (state + payroll + governance)</li>
<li>Confirm owner and status for each open item</li>
<li>Verify any org info changes that require updated filings</li>
<li>Confirm payroll reporting/deposit workflow is on track</li>
<li>Capture board decisions/minutes and any policy updates</li>
<li>Verify volunteer screening/training due dates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common failure patterns we keep seeing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compliance is tracked in scattered spreadsheets with no owner accountability</li>
<li>"We'll remember later" for state filing windows</li>
<li>Payroll and governance tasks treated as separate systems</li>
<li>No monthly review ritual, so deadlines are discovered late</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Compliance Tracker helps</h2>
<p>Turn this from a static checklist into a recurring operating system:
- State-specific deadline tracking
- Reminder windows before due dates
- Explicit task ownership
- Completion/proof log for board and audit confidence</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Compliance Tracker does not reduce legal requirements or filing burden. It reduces admin coordination burden (missed deadlines, unclear owners, weak follow-through).</p>
