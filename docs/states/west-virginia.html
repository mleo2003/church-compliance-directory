<h1>Church Compliance Deadlines in West Virginia (2026)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a directory of publicly available official resources — not legal or tax advice.</strong> We link to official state and federal agency pages so church admins can find the right starting point. For advice specific to your situation, consult a licensed attorney or CPA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>West Virginia churches operate in a state with a full complement of nonprofit and payroll compliance obligations, even though the absolute volume of filings is manageable. The Secretary of State requires annual reports, the State Tax Department administers payroll withholding, and the Workforce West Virginia agency handles unemployment insurance. The challenge for many West Virginia churches — particularly those in rural communities with small administrative teams — is that compliance ownership is often informal and the deadlines aren't obviously visible until they've passed.</p>
<h2>Who this applies to</h2>
<ul>
<li>West Virginia churches that operate as nonprofit entities</li>
<li>Church admins, executive pastors, finance teams, and board secretaries</li>
<li>Churches with employees and recurring payroll obligations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verified West Virginia filing points</h2>
<h3>1) West Virginia nonprofit registration/reporting cycle</h3>
<p>West Virginia nonprofit corporations are required to file an annual report with the West Virginia Secretary of State. The annual report is due by July 1 each year, making it a mid-year deadline that can be overlooked during summer ministry seasons. Filing is done through the Secretary of State's online Business Filings portal. The filing requires the organization to confirm its registered agent, principal office address, and officers. Failure to file results in administrative dissolution.</p>
<p>West Virginia's charitable solicitation registration is administered through the Secretary of State's office as well. Religious organizations, including churches, are generally exempt from charitable solicitation registration under West Virginia law when soliciting from their own membership or congregation. Churches that solicit from the broader public — through mail campaigns, online donation appeals, or community fundraising events targeting non-members — should confirm whether the exemption applies to those specific activities.</p>
<p>Churches should ensure their registered agent information is kept current. West Virginia requires a registered agent with a physical address in the state — a P.O. box is not sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> July 1 is the annual report deadline for all West Virginia nonprofits. Build a May reminder to begin the filing process, especially given summer scheduling pressures. Confirm the charitable solicitation exemption applies to your ministry's specific fundraising activities.</p>
<h3>2) West Virginia payroll tax obligations</h3>
<p>West Virginia employers, including churches with paid staff, are required to withhold West Virginia state income tax from employee wages. The primary withholding mechanism uses the state's income tax withholding system administered by the West Virginia State Tax Department. Employers submit withholding tax returns (Form IT-101) on a monthly or quarterly basis, depending on their average monthly withholding. Annual reconciliation is required. West Virginia transitioned through significant income tax changes in recent years, including rate reductions — confirm current rates and filing requirements with the State Tax Department.</p>
<p>West Virginia employers must also register with Workforce West Virginia (formerly WorkForce WV) for state unemployment insurance (SUI). Quarterly wage reports are required and due by the last day of the month following each quarter. Religious organizations may elect to become reimbursing employers rather than paying quarterly UI contributions — this election is documented with Workforce West Virginia and is often advantageous for churches with stable, long-tenured employees.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Confirm your withholding filing frequency with the WV State Tax Department. Set quarterly calendar reminders for Workforce WV unemployment reports. Review the reimbursing employer election with your CPA if you haven't already.</p>
<h3>3) Federal church filing requirement nuance</h3>
<p>IRS guidance states that tax-exempt organizations generally file annual returns, but churches and some church-affiliated organizations may be excepted.</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Don't assume "all churches file 990" or "no churches file anything." Validate your exact entity/facts with your tax advisor.</p>
<h2>Monthly church compliance checklist (practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review upcoming 90-day deadlines (state + payroll + governance)</li>
<li>Confirm owner and status for each open item</li>
<li>Verify any org info changes that require updated filings</li>
<li>Confirm payroll reporting/deposit workflow is on track</li>
<li>Capture board decisions/minutes and any policy updates</li>
<li>Verify volunteer screening/training due dates</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common failure patterns we keep seeing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compliance is tracked in scattered spreadsheets with no owner accountability</li>
<li>"We'll remember later" for state filing windows</li>
<li>Payroll and governance tasks treated as separate systems</li>
<li>No monthly review ritual, so deadlines are discovered late</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Compliance Tracker helps</h2>
<p>Turn this from a static checklist into a recurring operating system:
- State-specific deadline tracking
- Reminder windows before due dates
- Explicit task ownership
- Completion/proof log for board and audit confidence</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Compliance Tracker does not reduce legal requirements or filing burden. It reduces admin coordination burden (missed deadlines, unclear owners, weak follow-through).</p>
