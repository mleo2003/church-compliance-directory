<h1>Church Compliance Deadlines in Wisconsin (2026)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a directory of publicly available official resources — not legal or tax advice.</strong> We link to official state and federal agency pages so church admins can find the right starting point. For advice specific to your situation, consult a licensed attorney or CPA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wisconsin churches operate under a relatively straightforward nonprofit compliance framework, but the state does layer in a charitable solicitation registration requirement that many smaller congregations overlook. If your church solicits donations from the public — including online giving pages — that registration obligation may apply. This guide surfaces the key annual touchpoints so your admin team isn't caught off guard.</p>
<h2>Who this applies to</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wisconsin churches that operate as nonprofit entities incorporated under Wisconsin law</li>
<li>Church admins, executive pastors, finance teams, and board secretaries</li>
<li>Churches with employees and recurring payroll obligations</li>
<li>Churches that solicit charitable contributions from Wisconsin residents</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verified Wisconsin filing points</h2>
<h3>1) Wisconsin nonprofit registration and annual report cycle</h3>
<p>Wisconsin nonprofits — including churches incorporated as nonprofit corporations — file an annual report with the <strong>Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (DFI)</strong>. The report is due by the end of the quarter in which the corporation's anniversary date falls.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (DFI), Division of Corporate and Consumer Services</li>
<li><strong>Filing portal:</strong> https://www.wdfi.org/corporations/</li>
<li><strong>Fee:</strong> Typically $10 for nonprofits (confirm current fee at time of filing)</li>
<li><strong>What triggers it:</strong> Any Wisconsin nonprofit corporation registered with DFI</li>
<li><strong>Consequence of missing it:</strong> The state can administratively dissolve a corporation that fails to file its annual report. Reinstatement is possible but involves additional paperwork and fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Churches that are unincorporated associations are not subject to DFI annual report requirements, but they also lack the liability protections that come with incorporation. Most larger churches are incorporated.</p>
<h3>2) Wisconsin charitable solicitation registration</h3>
<p>Wisconsin requires organizations that solicit charitable contributions from Wisconsin residents to register with the <strong>Wisconsin Department of Justice — Charitable Organization Bureau</strong>, administered under the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Wisconsin DOJ, Charitable Organization Bureau</li>
<li><strong>Registration portal:</strong> https://www.doj.state.wi.us/charitable-organizations</li>
<li><strong>Renewal cadence:</strong> Annual</li>
<li><strong>Key threshold:</strong> Organizations raising less than $25,000 and not compensating professional fundraisers may qualify for an exemption. Religious organizations soliciting only from their own members may also qualify for exemption — but this is a fact-specific determination.</li>
<li><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Do not assume your church is automatically exempt. If you run online giving pages visible to the general public or solicit outside your congregation, confirm your exemption status with your legal advisor or check the DOJ exemption criteria directly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3) Wisconsin payroll tax obligations</h3>
<p>Wisconsin has a state income tax and requires employers to withhold state income tax from employee wages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agency:</strong> Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR)</li>
<li><strong>Deposit form:</strong> WT-6 (Withholding Tax Deposit)</li>
<li><strong>Deposit frequency:</strong> Monthly or quarterly, depending on annual withholding liability. Employers withholding $1,200 or more annually typically deposit monthly; those below that threshold may qualify for quarterly deposits. Verify your assigned schedule with DOR.</li>
<li><strong>Annual reconciliation:</strong> WT-7 (Annual Reconciliation of Wisconsin Income Tax Withheld), due January 31 of the following year</li>
<li><strong>DOR portal:</strong> https://www.revenue.wi.gov/Pages/FAQS/pcs-wthhold.aspx</li>
<li><strong>Unemployment Insurance:</strong> Wisconsin DWD (Department of Workforce Development) administers UI. Quarterly wage reports are due approximately one month after each quarter end. Portal: https://dwd.wisconsin.gov/ui201/</li>
</ul>
<p>Churches with employees must register as employers with both DOR (withholding) and DWD (unemployment insurance) if they have covered employees. Some religious organizations may qualify for UI exemption — review the DWD guidance for religious organizations specifically.</p>
<h3>4) Federal church filing requirement nuance</h3>
<p>IRS guidance states that tax-exempt organizations generally file annual returns (Form 990 series), but <strong>churches</strong> and certain church-affiliated organizations may be excepted from this requirement under IRC Section 6033(a)(3).</p>
<p><strong>Operational takeaway:</strong> Don't assume "all churches file 990" or "no churches file anything." Validate your exact entity/facts with your tax advisor. If your organization is a church-affiliated school, daycare, or separately incorporated ministry, the 990 exemption may not apply to that entity.</p>
<h2>Monthly church compliance checklist (practical)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Review upcoming 90-day deadlines (state + payroll + governance)</li>
<li>Confirm owner and status for each open item</li>
<li>Verify any org info changes that require updated filings (address, officers, registered agent)</li>
<li>Confirm payroll reporting/deposit workflow is on track (WT-6 deposits, federal 941 deposits)</li>
<li>Capture board decisions/minutes and any policy updates</li>
<li>Verify volunteer screening/training due dates</li>
<li>Confirm charitable solicitation registration is current if applicable</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common failure patterns we keep seeing</h2>
<ol>
<li>Compliance is tracked in scattered spreadsheets with no owner accountability</li>
<li>"We'll remember later" for DFI annual report windows — especially when the anniversary quarter sneaks up mid-year</li>
<li>Payroll and governance tasks treated as separate systems with no unified calendar</li>
<li>Charitable solicitation registration overlooked entirely because "we assumed churches are exempt"</li>
<li>No monthly review ritual, so deadlines are discovered late</li>
</ol>
<h2>How Compliance Tracker helps</h2>
<p>Turn this from a static checklist into a recurring operating system:
- State-specific deadline tracking for Wisconsin DFI, DOR, DWD, and DOJ obligations
- Reminder windows before due dates
- Explicit task ownership
- Completion/proof log for board and audit confidence</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Compliance Tracker does not reduce legal requirements or filing burden. It reduces admin coordination burden (missed deadlines, unclear owners, weak follow-through).</p>
